WildstarMouselockRebind
=======================

AutoHotKey script compliment to WildstarMouselockIndicatorPixel

When Wildstar is active, rebinds mouse L and R to 1 and -, depending on the state of the GameLib.IsMouseLockOn() indicator.

Requires https://github.com/Xuerian/MouselockIndicatorPixel to work.
