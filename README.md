WildstarMouselockRebind
=======================

NOTE: This functionality should be part of WildStar itself and not done through addons, as it treads near problematic areas

CARBINE: Adding a "Alternate actions during mouselock" checkbox and two keybind fields is all that is needed to replace this, allowing users to define a different action to perform in "combat mode"

AutoHotKey script compliment to WildstarMouselockIndicatorPixel

When Wildstar is active, rebinds mouse L and R to 1 and -, depending on the state of the GameLib.IsMouseLockOn() indicator.

Requires https://github.com/Xuerian/MouselockIndicatorPixel to work.
